# Cars 4 â€“ An Arduino Line Follower Robot.

## Strategy:

The robot uses the bang-bang method to pass the track, with special cases included like cuts in track and intersections.

The robot uses a photoresistor to continue running after it stops due to the stopping special case. ***(Can be edited or removed)***

## Hardware:

- Arduino Uno.
- IR Sensor Modules (x5): [Link](http://ram-e-shop.com/oscmax/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=3213).
- Two motors and Two Wheels (FWD).
- 9V Battery for the Arduino, 12V or more for both of the motors. UltraFire Li-ion and Wild Scorpion Li-Po batteries were used.
- Photoresistor.
